Vitter had this to say of his connection to the prostitution service : `` This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible. Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling. Out of respect for my family, I will keep my discussion of the matter there-with God and them. But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way. `` During his campaign for the U.S. Senate, Vitter had been accused of going to a prostitute, a charge that he then vigorously denied. Now, of course, he's been caught, and he admits it. Meanwhile, Vitter expressed strong support last year for a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He compared same-sex marriage to hurricanes Katrine and Rita. He said, `` I don't believe there's any issue that's more important than this one. `` It is always amazing when the self-proclaimed defenders of supposedly traditional marriage, the politicians who bolster their campaigns by appealing to popular anti-gay prejudice, are exposed for the hypocrites they are.

Major changes occurred between these diverse life forms ( i.e., fish changed to amphibians, amphibians changed to reptiles, and reptiles changed to birds or mammals ).
