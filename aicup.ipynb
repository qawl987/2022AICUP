ERV = useless code in DNA, but present in all members of a species Basically it goes like this. Viruses inject their DNA into the hosts DNA. This means that if the cell is able to replicate itself, it also replicates the viral DNA. As we all accept, creationists as well, sometimes things go wrong during this replication process. Sometimes, the viral DNA is rendered inactive. This is inconsequential as the cell dies and the error dies with it. But sometimes, this can happen to sperm cells that just happen to end up fertilizing. Therefore, the organism that is born from the fertilized egg carries this viral error ( ERV ) permanently and then passes it on. Since we can sequence viral DNA and have sequenced the entire human genome, we can go hunting for these viral sequences that have actually been propagating for millions of years. This is testable, every human on the planet has the same ERV\\'s each of which has resulted from a SINGLE little virus doing its thing at some point in our evolutionary history. For evolution to be false, and this is a golden opportunity for creationists to prove it false, you would have to see that in apes none of these ERVs are present and they would have their own unique set of ERVs. When we looked, we found them and in the exact right place out of billions of sequences. The only way this can currently be explained is with evolution.

But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Until others told her it is normal to like men. A boy had almost the same experience, he did not know if he too should like men, because his father did. Often he would fight back desires for females, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay. Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1 % of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine.
